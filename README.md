# <Console-Finances>

## Description

In this project we are tasked with building a financial analysis tool. This is a real-world situation in which we are tasked with testing our newfound JavaScript skills. Using 'for' loops, we analyse a data set and extrapolate that date to find the profit and losses in total as well as tracked over time.

## Installation

Please either pull from this repository OR download the file, extract its contents and open it to view and edit. It was created using VS code but alternative similar software can be used. As the file was intended to show it's findings to the console, open the <index.html> file in your browser, right click on the screen when open and then click "inspect" in the drop down menu. Navigate to the section labelled "Console". Click on that to view the findings of the data set.
